Backstory:
The Emberwisp Stag was a majestic forest guardian, its antlers glowing with the light of fireflies. The elemental surge corrupted its light into a malevolent force, turning its once-protective nature into a territorial rage. It now hunts anything that disrupts the forest’s silence, believing it defends a sacred grove that no longer exists.

Visual Description for AI Art Prompt:
A low-poly stag standing tall, with a sleek, angular body made of dark brown and gray facets, resembling charred wood. Its antlers are large, branching, and jagged, glowing with orange and yellow wisps that flicker like embers, forming a crown-like structure. The eyes are hollow, with a faint red glow deep within. Small, glowing particles float around its body, suggesting magical corruption. The legs are thin and sharp, with hoof-like points that dig into the ground. The low-poly design uses flat, triangular surfaces to create a crystalline, almost ghostly appearance, with a minimal color palette of dark browns, grays, and glowing oranges. The background is a dark forest clearing with faint firefly-like lights scattered in the air.
